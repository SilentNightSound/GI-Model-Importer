# Takes the vertex groups on one model and renames them to match as closely as possible with another while filling in gaps
# This script does not add or remove vertex groups or change any group weights - it only renames them
# If two vertex groups are both similar to the same output group x, will name them x.0001, x.0002 etc. instead of merging
# Merge duplicate vertices before using, otherwise behavior can be unpredictable

# Order is source -> destination (e.g. if you want to map character1's vertex groups onto character2, set the source as character1 and the destination character2)

# EXPERIMENTAL, still in development
